### FOR changes required for v3 please refer to the [v3 branch](https://github.com/Sage/sageone_api_php_sample/tree/v3)
##### NOTE: v3 is currently under development. It is only available in Canada [Beta]

Sample PHP project that integrates with Sage One Accounting via the Sage One API.

* Authentication and API calls are handled in  [sageone_client.php](sageone_client.php)
* Request signing is handled in [sageone_signer.php](sageone_signer.php).
* Callback is handled in [callback.php](callback.php), point the callback_url here.

## Run the app locally

Clone the repo:

`git clone git@github.com:Sage/sageone_api_php_sample.git`

Update the [sageone_constants.php](sageone_constants.php) file with your application's `client_id`, `client_secret`, `signing_secret` and `callback_url`.

Switch to the project directory and start a local PHP server:

```
cd sageone_api_php_sample
php -S localhost:8000
```

You can now access the [home page](http://localhost:8000/), authorize and make an API call.
